# MONSIF H4CK3R - C2 Payload Overview

🚫 This is **not** a developed or modified code by me. Anyone who wants extra features, build them yourself.

---

## 🔐 Encryption
- AES-128 (ECB) for C2 communications  
- Switch to AES-CBC in production

## 🔑 String Obfuscation
- All critical strings XOR-encrypted

## 🛡️ TLS
- C2 over HTTPS using self-signed certs

## 🔁 Persistence
- Registry Run Key setup for startup

## 🧪 Anti-Sandbox
- Checks tick count before execution

---

## 🗺️ Functionality Map

- 📍 Auto-connect to C2 via encrypted beacons  
- 📍 Keylogger with active window context  
- 📍 Web panel for managing targets  
- 📍 Command queuing system  
- 📍 Fake bank injection template included  
- 📍 AES + XOR dual-layer obfuscation  

---

## 🛠️ Production Notes

- Replace `YOUR_C2_IP` with a VPS or Onion service  
- Add Chrome/Firefox cookie extraction  
- Implement process hollowing for stealth  
- Inject junk/polymorphic code before compilation  
- Use domain fronting for C2 masking

---

## 💣 Final Words

This ain't script kiddie junk. Real opsec required:

- Burner VPS only  
- Domain fronting and proxies  
- Encrypted dead drops

Client is modular – expand with:

- RAM scraping  
- Screenshot capture  
- Remote control  
- File system access

🔒 AVs eat static samples alive. Go fileless post-infection. Stay invisible.
